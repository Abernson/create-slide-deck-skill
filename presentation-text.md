# Markdown for professional content delivery & AI agent interactions

## What is Markdown?

- A plain text format with simple symbols for formatting (# headers, *bold*, - lists)
- Decouples visual design from text formatting
- Created in 2004 to be readable as-is and convertible to HTML
- The standard for README files, documentation, notes apps, and AI communication

## Why Markdown?

- One source of endlessly transformable truth, from your editor to websites, docs, and presentations
- Your formatting intentions survive any pipeline; transforming to Markdown first provides stability
- AI agents read and write Markdown natively
- Human-readable even in raw form, no hidden formatting gremlins

## Why Now?

- "English is the new programming language." Specific, structured, declarative writing wins
- Deliver exact formatting to clients who are going to be transforming to/from Markdown
- Your documents become executable: skills, automation, workflows

## Best Practices

- Think structure-first: outline before prose
- Use headers to organize - they become your navigation
- Let go of visual control - the output adapts to wherever it lands
- Plain text is a feature: version control, diffs, collaboration

## Demo: Cursor Agent
